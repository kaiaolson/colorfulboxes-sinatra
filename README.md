# Colorful Boxes
Sinatra web application that takes two rgb values from the user and produces two boxes in those colors.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
First, make sure you have Sinatra installed:

<pre>gem install sinatra</pre>

Then run with: 

<pre>ruby coffee_cake_app.rb</pre>

View at: http://localhost:4567

It is recommended to also run <code>gem install thin</code>, which Sinatra will pick up if available.
